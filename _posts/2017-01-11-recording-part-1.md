# recording part 1

## **Personal Refections on these days of recording**

* Recording sounds is an immensely exhausting activity! But.... (at least!) equally rewarding and fulfilling to do!
* The experimenting with different set-ups and ways of \[de-\]constructing & \[de-\]contextualising the sounds on their own & as a whole, is something that kept me going on for hours and hours and hours. Sunday we started at 10 a.m. & finished late in the evening: We had to leave before the alarm would go off at 10 p.m.
* Dealing with the mysterious and uncontrollable, yet ever forgiving & lovely aspect of randomness, that is loyal to no man and never unfaithful to that same person, has become an increasingly important part in my artistic and personal growth.
* I can't possibly begin to grasp how to write down in words or describe the energy I receive while working on these sonorous adventures & projects ---\> We will have to listen to the results!
* Speaking of the recordings: Enough time spent on writing ... time for some editing!
* I will be taking 2 days off to spend time with Karen's family in the Ardennen (no man's land), and after that, it's right back to work, although it would never cross my mind to think of it as "work" in the general sense of the word!
* So Looking forward to Module 4! seeing (hearing? ;-) ) my EPAS colleges again & working, without a doubt intensely, under the guidance of Martine Huvenne, André Bendochhi-Alves & Martin Parker!

## **Testing out the equipment**

Recording for Session \[x\] pt.1 & ReLiV \[1\] @Nederpolder 161105 & 161106

_"There is no such thing as an empty space or an empty time: There is always something to see, something to hear. In fact, try as we may to make a silence, we cannot." - _John Cage

### **Used equipment**

* Recorder - NagraVI \[recording @192kHz\]
* Mic's: AKG C414 & DPA 4041

I was giving a workshop 'Musica Futurista' for Matrix - Centre of New Music, on the fourth of November in Lier: Making Crackle-boxes & creating sound-paintings & improvisations with these youngsters was a lot of fun, so I didn't have the chance to pick up the required equipment for the recording session: Mathilde was so kind to get all the equipment that was needed for the upcoming days - Thanks Mathilde!

**Test-recordings 001-006**

trying out the DPA4041 mic's because well.... you gotta start somewhere... or in this case not one place but two at the same time! (insert stereo joke here...). So I started messing around with some "stereo" set-ups in my kitchen and the rest of my studio. After first getting acquainted with the - very awesome and rather easy to use - recorder and the DPA's again, it was time to get those C414 beauties out and make 'em shine. Don't pay attention to the stuff all over my apartment, the picture are just there to give you an insight in the DIY set-up's and testing-scenario's. After a few test-recordings, we went downstairs Checking out the acoustic & recording qualities of the audio-recorder, mic's and the rooms themselves! This obviously led to some more experimentation, who should have guessed? ;-) So... we went inside the toilet to record. We used the C414 as stereo pair in the toilet and messed around with the location of the 2 4041's (inside the room, outside the room, outside with window open) what an incredible sonic experience ... bathrooms will never be the same again.

Onto the real deal: Searching for a particular space and buildings where we could try-out a day of recordings Sunday. The Nederpolder is a rather "forgotten" building (part of School of Arts) where the Instrument builders reside. and because it was a weekend & a holiday in Belgium, we had the whole place to ourselves! Firstly we went to the "GroteZaal" on the 4th Floor and I made my initial set-up & we made our first six test-recordings. Apart from the 1 noisy Ventilation shaft this seemed to be a good starting point for the day to come. (pic 1)

## **Recording for ReLiV \[x\]**

06/11/16 @Nederpolder - with Tim Duerinck, Leoni De Schrijver, Karen Wolfs, Mathilde Strijdonk, Charlotte Velghe.

We started off at where we ended yesterday mainly @Nederpolder "GroteZaal" with One of the many set-ups we used (1) mainly: 2x dpa-4041 Front & Back.

### **Recordings 001-005**

While writing this post I can quite vividly remember all the different rooms we used and especially all the fun we had! An example of this fun & also of how good my friends are to me is the following: So I asked my good friends and colleagues to join me on my recording quest: Specifying that they should bring shoe's... (2).

### **Recordings 006-021**

after the mic's being at the Front&Back of the Room, I placed them Left & Right (close to each other as in (3), and every time further and further apart to, later on, play with the stereo image in the recording.

### **Recordings 023-035**

Time to move to another location: so much more left to explore & my oh my, this building has a lovely staircase: I just had to let my self go and explore the many sonorous possibilities of this space! We placed 1 DPA on the upper floor (4th) & 1 DPA downstairs (recorder on second floor) = GREAT FUN! (& once again a big thank you to everyone involved! ---\> awww just look at those cuties! ;-) )

### **Recordings 036-051**

after spending a "super fun time" hitting the metal bars & letting them reverberate, I was in the mood for some more experimenting with sounds and space! (well what do you know...Module 3 of EPAS - the time spent with Nicolas Becker & Els Viaene - is buzzing constantly through my head. Which meant to try out "transforming" the analogue sound more and more. Sound & Space were the main subjects, but adding adding different materials to play with in that space created yet another dimension I wanted to capture sonorously. One example is Leonie scratching the surface area of a styrofoam cello made by Tim. Tim Duerinck is a PhD student at the School of Arts experimenting with new materials for instruments and best materials to transfer/create sounds.

We went to the 3rd floor of the Nederpolder & continued our sonore adventure in one of the instrument builders rooms. As you can see in one of the pictures, we got the lid on the underside of the upright piano off & put the DPA's close to the resonating strings (as a stereo pair) & well... Things escalated quickly! (in a good way!) So why not add long cylindrical tubes to the process: to transform the original sound in an analogue way even more!

### **Recordings 052-057**

This experimenting led to some very nice recordings, but I wanted to use a grand piano & we also had to start the recordings for Mathilde. The list of sounds for the theater performance SESSION\[1\] so ---\> off to the klanklabo!

First of all making a set-up was necessary: with 4 mic's in the Klanklabo: DPA's went in GrandPiano and AKG acted as stereo pair.

before going over and recording the list of sounds, I was in the mood for some more transformations of objects in sound & space. The time spent with Nicolas Becker last module in the Music Studio of the Bijloke gave me an idea: I decided to record sound of a cellphone vibrating on the low strings of the grand piano & the voicemail & funny error massages that went along with it.

Here I once again was confronted with the fact that - following my gut feeling and experimenting - \[in other words: stepping out of my comfort zone and just letting it go!\] are very important parts in this life-long sonorous adventure I'm undertaking.

## **Recording for Session \[x\]**

Klanklabo (3rd Floor) - 4mic set-up: 2x AKG C414 (Front & back 50cm apart) & 2x DPA-4041 that were placed by Tim, who was assisting me, in all sorts of objects & angles for different room- and sound-effects needed for the narrative and concept of the sounds I was going to use for Session \[x\]

Although it became time to continue our work on the sounds we outlined in advance: transforming the sound would play an important role in the following ±50 recordings. Mathilde and I had conceived a list with the sounds we wanted to record & Tim was so kind to be my assistant/experimentation buddy in this process.

We recorded Mathilde with the 2x AKG C414's: Closed micing with one mic and one a little further away - 50cm distance from the 1st one. While at the same time placing the DPA's in different smaller self conceived/constructed rooms: Trashcans, metal trays, pots, closets, ...

The idea behind these smaller and more "suffocating" spaces had to do with the concept behind Session\[x\] I was envisioning.

### **Recordings 059-101**

The ideas and recordings described below are all part of the concept and performance of SESSION \[x\]. For more info about the incredible performances of Mathilde Strijdonk & Session \[x\], see my personal artistic project!

What she can do, starting from her body and only breath is simply put amazing. I'm truly humbled that we decided to work out her "creative baby" and let it enter the sonorous world!

These words are, for my artistic approach to the performance, starting points & guidelines to mangle this world with sound! So by just reading these, you will have an idea of the sounds on it's own, but you won't have any idea of the correlation to the performance: That's totally fine though ---\> that part of the process will be for a later stage.

More info on the upcoming performances soon ---\> now back to the recordings!
