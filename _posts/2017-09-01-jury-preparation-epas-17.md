Jury Preparation EPAS '17

To Prepare us for the upcoming Jury the 09th of September, we received an email from the Belgian coordinator \[Martine Huvenne\] with the following suggestions:  
"...make sure that you inform us about following topics:

* -  Introduction of your project
* -  Motivation of your project
* -  Background information of your project
* -  About the research you did
* -  Actions ( dairy)
* -  Motivation of the choices you did ( Results thrown away)
* -  Motivation of the presentation form ( distribution of sound)"

In the following sections I will try to recap the points that were outlined above, the way I interpreted them...
