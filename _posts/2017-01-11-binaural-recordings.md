# Binaural Recordings

A collection of my binaural recording during the EPAS postgraduate

# Binaural Recordings

FYI: Each headphone-channel is sending a different track to each ear. This lets your mind create the "binaural effect" when listening to these recordings. If you listen to a binaural recording without headphones, both ears will hear the mixed signals and therefore the binaural effect will not be generated!

## **Binaural Field Recording Exercises Module 1**

September 2016 @ School of Arts, Ghent (BE).   
Mentor: Ben Zijlstra.   
equipment used: Roland-R26 + DPA4041 microphones.

This was my first hands on experience with binaural recordings and it literally opened up a whole new sonorous world for me! Especially after the intense experience with Els Viaene's soundwalk the day before: Which made me rethink my way of listening. Specifically: The significant difference between listening and hearing & the way I envisioned, or rather listened to the world around me. Every moment of every day is a "random" composition that is played out in front of our ears.

Hence the following three unedited examples the 21 recordings I made the 2nd of September.

### **Binaural Field Recording Exercise 1**

Leaving the Hercules lab @School of Arts, Ghent (Be) I could hear the radio that was playing just outside on the street. The radio was from the construction workers that were taking their break and eating their lunch.

This scenery felt so surreal, as if I opened a door and stepped into another world where I was one of the set pieces in a movie-scene. So... I lighted a cigarette, which would be one of my last 'cause I stopped smoking mid Novembe; and enjoyed the sonorous surroundings.

### **Binaural Field Recording Exercise 2**

Although I was using windcaps on the microphones, this recording was my first practical encounter with the issues that rather strong winds can bring with them. Apart from these issues, it also brings a certain vibe/atmosphere with it that I love to re-listen. A windy day recording of the inner campus @KASK. There is a person passing by at a certain point, this for me was such a strong indication of the effect that binaural recordings can have in comparison to other types of recording. The effect of the people passing by was way more intense 'cause of my focus being on hearing instead of seeing!

**Binaural Field Recording Exercise 3**

During my walk around the campus I stumbled upon the cleaning ladies. They were feeding the chickens and I was fascinated by the one that got "exiled" by the rest. This recording is mostly a conversation between the ladies, who weren't aware that I was recording. For the most part of the recording you will hear them talking in Dutch. They are talking about the chickens, but the topic on its own isn't that important for the recording. What was very interesting to me was hearing them talk and the fluctuation in their voices depending on the kind of emotion they wanted to emit. This symbolic layer is, although surely influenced by culture and the sort of language used, something universal. It made me reflect on my practice as a composer. Specifically on the topic of prescriptive and descriptive ways of composing music. This was the topic of my master thesis at the conservatory in Ghent.

To keep the conversation going I had to post short questions in between as to keep them talking. This led me to the second, rather obvious, discovery: Your own voice is amplified immensely in comparison though.

Ah the cleaning ladies... Since I did my undergrad and grad studies as a composer in Ghent, I knew them fairly well and listening to this conversation reminds me time and time again about their sympathetic, social and kind nature. Thank you ladies!

## Binaural Recordings Module 2 - NFA Amsterdam

October 2016 @[NFA][0], Amsterdam (NL)  
Mentor: Cilia Erens & Martine Huvenne  
equipment used: Roland-R26 + DPA4041 microphones.

These are two unedited examples of exercises given to us to hone our recording capabilities & realising the importance of your own body and movement when recording.
