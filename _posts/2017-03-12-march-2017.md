March 2017

Getting ready for my first visit to the IFS in Cologne

Starting tomorrow, the 13th of March, I will be at IFS to

1. Partake in the Digital Narrative Master courses
2. Connect with my mentor and plan the upcoming months
3. Hopefully be able to set-up a performance of Session \[x\]! 

Very Curious what this week will bring!
