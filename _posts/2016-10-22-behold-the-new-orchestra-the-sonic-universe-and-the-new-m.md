What is EPAS?

EPAS is a one-year intensive course in the creative potential of sound both of itself and as part of a multi media practice. The innovative curriculum emphasises the development of creative practice alongside technical craft and embraces research as essential in supporting self and creative development. EPAS is the shortened version of a planned but postponed two-year MA in Sound, with a certificate as outcome.

The partners of EPAS Consortium are KASK, School of Arts Gent, HoGent, Belgium; Netherlands Film Academy, The Netherlands; and ifs Internationale Filmschule KÃ¶ln, Germany; The School of Sound, UK; ENSATT, France; Le Fresnoy -- Studio national des arts contemporains (Torching), France; Edinburgh College of Art, University of Edinburgh, UK; Festival International du Film d'Aubagne, France and Film Fest Gent, Belgium are associated partners of the EPAS consortium. The consortium can invite other associated partners in order to optimize the education.
