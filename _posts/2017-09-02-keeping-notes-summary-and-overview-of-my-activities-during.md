### **Week11**

**- first visit to the IFS = making planning + workflow setup**

13/03/2017 - Jorghe Ihle - Transmedia Storyworlds

10.15 presenting myself - very nice and hearted welcome by diverse group  
10.45 Jorge Transmedia presentation  
went from films ---\> via games ---\> to toys/themeparks (Europark)  
_**content**_ centered in the experience! (not in germany though - in usa it is!)  
_**Games**_ very interesting in the ways they are able to tell stories.  
A great _**storyworld**_ takes me to a place that lets me...  
go somewhere i could never go, be someone i could never be, do things i could never do...  
Story (rock above water) comparison to story-world (rest of the rock below the water)• complexity of storyworlds ---\> angry birds, Donkey Kong, Pac-Man vs Bible or Lord of the Rings, ..._**==\>Very interesting for my question ---\> concept vs narrative!!! (storyworld vs story)**_It's all about the big **"What if?"** question. (High-concept):  
**Define this as precise and specific as possible when communicating! **Example: jurassic park ---\> what if Dinosaurs were alive due to cloning  
Came out after the first sheep that was cloned + it's actually a modern take on 'Frankenstein'  
**Character- vs Concept-driven**  
Character-driven Worlds: James Bond, Mickey Mouse, ....  
Concept-driven Worlds • Jurassic Park, Bioshock, Tron, the Hunger Games  
**What if** there was a game where teens from different classes kill each other?  
LOTR is no high-concept ---\> in general High-fantasy need loads of explanation  
Concept Gravity & orbiting concept (from jurassic park to jurassic world)  
**Reverse Engineering**  
cq. _**Lego's **_'Transmedia' Ecosystem  
_**Immersion**_James Cameron his Avatar - roommate from Jorge worked as artistic designer on the plants for weeks ---\> cameron wants to build his world from the "grain" up  
Larping & Tabletop RPG's  
burning man experience from Jorghe with the thunderdome from mad max  
Immersion in Games  
Leaning forward (actively participating) vs Leaning backward (coach potato)  
New Founding fathers of America ---\> _**The Purge**_What IF ... For one night a year, there are no rules -\>they have their own website  
part of universal theme park made its own Escape Room experience - very immersive  
Jorge works for MackMedia (company behind this park)  
creating VR world with one of the brands on a rollercoaster  
13.00 Break  
14.00 Jorge Transmedia presentation pt2  
Europark Mouse ---\> building the character into a brand  
Everything is nowadays related to licensing  
15.30 Exercise 1 - pitch a concept with the 6 elements - "Whale-Unition"

14/03/2017 - Jorghe Ihle & Dominik .... - Transmedia Storyworlds  
10.00 insight in their working process and ways they work:  
Their approach when writing scenes/works, different endings, ...  
about **dramaturgy**combination of _**craft**_ (commercial) & _**inspiration**_ ("artsy")  
3 act story (the hero's journey) & the 8 sequence template (from the [scriptlab.com][1])  
Jorg and Dominik their Dramaturgy version applied in: Adventure Club of Europe (trans-media brand)  
13.00 lunch  
13.45 Pitching everyones story/project in group  
16.00 meeting with the Dean (Simone) & Su  
17.00 Guided tour from the whole ifs by Su + call to jacha  
**What I definitely picked up:**-Make sure people can relate to your concept/story!  
-What a warm & open welcome! Felt immediately at ease and they were very clear about the topics we discussed  
- ask the **what if** question for my personal project  
**what if.... we could sonically experience the physical & mental strain/aspects of the human body.**

15/03/2017 - Jascha Viehl - Personal Project  
10\. preparing project for Jascha  
12\. taking public transport to Jascha  
13\. working with Jascha  
deciding on the project: make it interactive, Kinect (for her) - Leap motion! (For me)  
Defining the paramaters and triggering the sound  
acceleration as an important aspect  
example from reaktor that jascha worked with  
the 4 stances of the 4 characters define the atmospheres is a starting point.  
Using 5.1 cinema set-up - M. in center speaker - comparison to start of a film ---\> from center to sides ---\> opening it up!  
important to develop together: Defining the reactive parts and the most important sounds

16/03/2017 - Lena Thiele und Nanna Heidenreich „Westworld"  
10.00 Presentation by Lena ---\> Immersion and presence "at the center of it all: presence"  
Defining **Immersion** from different points of view  
as property of the system: perceptual respons to that system  
Response to an unfolding narrative, the diegetic space, or virtual characters  
immersion as a response to challenges demanding use of one's intellect or skill (gaming def)  
Some ways to describe it: "being somewhere without being there", "trying death, without the cost"  
Concept of **Presence **in correlation to immersion: 3 ways of immersion to work together - think of cube  
**challenge-based immersion (0,0,1), narrative immersion (1,0,0), system immersion (0,1,0)**13.00 lunch  
14.00continue presentation  
**USING LOOPED NARRATIVES FOR SESSION \[x\] for all 4 characters could be nice idea!**
