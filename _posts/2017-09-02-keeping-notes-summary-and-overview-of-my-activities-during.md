## **Week11 **

**- first visit to the IFS = making planning + workflow setup**

13/03/2017 - Jorghe Ihle - Transmedia Storyworlds

10.15 presenting myself - very nice and hearted welcome by diverse group

10.45 Jorge Transmedia presentation

went from films ---\> via games ---\> to toys/themeparks (Europark)

_**content**_ centered in the experience! (not in germany though - in usa it is!)

_**Games**_ very interesting in the ways they are able to tell stories.

A great _**storyworld**_ takes me to a place that lets me...

• go somewhere i could never go

• be someone i could never be

• do things i could never do

• Story (rock above water) comparison to story-world (rest of the rock below the water)

• complexity of storyworlds ---\> angry birds, Donkey Kong, Pac-Man vs Bible or Lord of the Rings, ...

_**==\>Very interesting for my question ---\> concept vs narrative!!! (storyworld vs story)**_

It's all about the big **"What if?"** question. (High-concept):

define this as precise and specific as possible when communicating this

Example: jurassic park ---\> what if Dinosaurs were alive due to cloning

came out after the first sheep that was cloned + it's actually a modern take on 'frankenstein'

different worlds:

Character-driven Worlds: James Bond, Mickey Mouse, ....

Concept-driven Worlds • Jurassic Park, Bioshock, Tron, the Hunger Games

• **What if** there was a game where teens from different classes kill each other?

• LOTR is no high-concept ---\> in general High-fantasy need loads of explanation

• Concept Gravity & orbiting concept (from jurassic park to jurassic world)

▾ Reverse Engineering

_**Lego's **_'Transmedia' Ecosystem

_**Immersion**_

James Cameron his Avatar - roommate from Jorge worked as artistic designer on the plants for weeks

---\> cameron wants to build his world from the "grain" up

Larping & Tabletop RPG's

burning man experience from Jorghe with the thunderdome from mad max

Immersion in Games

Leaning forward (actively participating) vs Leaning backward (coach potato)

▾ New Founding fathers of America ---\> _**The Purge**_

• What IF ... For one night a year, there are no rules

• they have their own website

• universal theme park made its own Escape Room experience - very immersive

Jorge works for MackMedia (company behind Europark)

• creating VR world with one of the brands on a rollercoaster

13.00 Break

14.00 Jorge Transmedia presentation pt2

• Europark Mouse ---\> building the character into a brand

• Everything is nowadays related to licensing

15.30 Exercise 1 - pitch a concept with the 6 elements - "Whale-Unition"

14/03/2017 - Jorghe Ihle & Dominik .... - Transmedia Storyworlds

10.00 insight in their working process and ways they work:

Their approach when writing scenes/works, different endings, ...

about **dramaturgy**

combination of _**craft**_ (commercial) & _**inspiration**_ ("artsy")

3 act story (the hero's journey) & the 8 sequence template (from the [scriptlab.com][0])

Jorg and Dominik their Dramaturgy version applied in: Adventure Club of Europe (trans-media brand)

13.00 lunch

13.45 Pitching everyones story/project in group

16.00 meeting with the Dean (Simone) & Su

17.00 Guided tour from the whole ifs by Su + call to jacha

What I definitely picked up:

-Make sure people can relate to your concept/story!

-What a warm & open welcome! Felt immediately at ease and they were very clear about the topics

we discussed

- ask the what if question for my personal project

what if.... we could sonically experience the physical & mental strain/aspects of the human body.

15/03/2017 - Jascha Viehl - Personal Project

10\. preparing project for Jascha

12\. taking public transport to Jascha

13\. working with Jascha

deciding on the project: make it interactive, Kinect (for her) - Leap motion! (For me)

• Defining the paramaters and triggering the sound

• acceleration as an important aspect

* example from reaktor that jascha worked with

•the 4 stances of the 4 characters define the atmospheres is a starting point.

Using 5.1 cinema set-up - M. in center speaker - comparison to start of a film ---\> from center to sides ---\> opening it up!

▾ important to develop together: Defining the reactive parts and the most important sounds

16/03/2017 - Lena Thiele und Nanna Heidenreich „Westworld"

10.00 Presentation by Lena ---\> Immersion and presence "at the center of it all: presence"

Defining **Immersion** from different points of view

as property of the system: perceptual respons to that system

Response to an unfolding narrative, the diegetic space, or virtual characters

immersion as a response to challenges demanding use of one's intellect or skill (gaming def)

Some ways to describe it: "being somewhere without being there", "trying death, without the cost"

Concept of **Presence **in correlation to immersion: 3 ways of immersion to work together - think of cube

challenge-based immersion (0,0,1), narrative immersion (1,0,0), system immersion (0,1,0)

13.00 lunch

14.00continue presentation
