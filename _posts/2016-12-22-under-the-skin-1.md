# **Under the Skin \[x\]**

## **Module 4 - Sound in new media**

Mentor: Dr. Martin Parker ([tinpark.com][0])

### **General info**

* Depicts my personal work that was part of Module 4 - On audiovisual composition.
* Collaboration with artist Léonie Zelger to create a live performed soundtrack to an existing film.
* original name of the film: In the Waves - 2015 by Jing-Fang Shen. Original soundtrack by Antonio J. Garcia

### **Concept**

After watching the film a few times, I had the idea of working in 2 distinct layers:

1. The first one being the organism(s)/cells with a focus on movement - as if it/you are constantly looking for something.
2. The second layer is formed by the background which is rather static with a focus on colours and emergence.

* A second thing that I wanted to incorporate is the way these two intertwine in the film: 1 becomes 2 to form a new 1 & at a certain point the other way around is true: Each 2 is formed from the previous 1\.

### **Putting it all into praxis**

We started by recording sounds that we found fitting for that specific scene. For the live-setup we would each control 1 of the 2 layers. The crucial aspect for me was the 'organic' feel in this performance: So the sounds we would incorporate in the live-performance needed to resemble the live-produced sounds. For this I used a recording technique acquired by the lessons during module 3 of Nicolas Becker. It involves recording at a very high quality (192kHz) and converting it down - to 48kHz - in your editing session. This gives the whole a very organic feel 'cause it is all coming from a very similar sonorous source.

> Ideas are one thing and what happens is another. - John Cage

**Set-up**

* working with max MSP patches that involved delay lines, loops of the pre-recorded sounds panned to 6 different speakers in the room & most importantly: randomising effects put in place by the audio-visual programming software.
  * **Incorporating \[seemingly uncontrollable\] randomness**, that is loyal to no man and never unfaithful to another, has become an increasingly important part in my artistic work & will play an important part in this research.
* 2 people performing: • 1\. "the Organism" being controlled by Leonie • 2\. "the background layers" being controlled by me.

### **Conclusion**

Working 1 day longer with Leonié would have been more then welcome, but the collaboration itself was very interesting: Her way of thinking and working gave me lots of new insights to start the project of!

The few moments spent with Martin diving into the programming were priceless: I learned so much and yet I know there is such a huge world yet to be explored in MaxMSP!

### **Result**

Enjoy the Stereo mixed-down of **Under the Skin \[1\]!**
