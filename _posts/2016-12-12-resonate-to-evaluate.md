# Resonate to evaluate

> There is no such thing as an empty space or an empty time: There is always something to see, something to hear. In fact, try as we may to make a silence, we cannot. - John Cage

Finally having the feeling that I can take a step back from my work to play the role of the observer.

Finding that I'm pretty good at giving advice to other people about their work and the next step they should take etc, but using this process in my own work was, and is still, very hard. Once I started working, I lost myself in the working process. By taking a step back, I can take the space and time to "resonate" and "evaluate" my own work and reflect on it. This skill is certainly something that I enhanced very strongly during the last four modules of EPAS!

On that 'note' --\> time to take the time to get my reflections from inside to a written form!

Therefore this part of the blog: which will be dedicated to my personal reflections: past and future.
